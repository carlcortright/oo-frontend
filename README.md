# Project Overview

In class, many students donâ€™t have the courage to ask a question in front of a large lecture. We plan to develop a webapp that will allow a student who has a question to text a phone number, adding their question to a queue for the professor to answer. The professor can then scan questions, and if the question is going to be answered in the upcoming slides she can then decide to defer answering until it is covered. 

# Installing and executing

In order to run this project, first make sure you have node js installed on your machine. After this is done, you must install dependencies using the node package manager (npm):

`npm install`

After all packages are installed you can start the app for local development

`npm start`
